## <a id='3'>The Power of Storytelling by Katori Hall</a>
	- Writing is a skill, to get better you need to practice
	- All stories start with:
		+! Character first
			* Surprises you
			* You learn from
		+ A specific being going on a journey
			* Save something to say
			* Get the thing they want & need
			* purpose
	-! Before the story, audience has to fall in love with the character  

	- My Takeaways:
		+ Start with the character
		+ Take them on a journey from the lens of the character 


## <a id='4'>Working Backwards the Amazon way by Jason Feldman</a>
	- Be customer obsessed
		+ Customers are NEVER complacent, competitors get complacent >> Leads to complacency and "letting up"
	- Provide great customer experience. Leads to More traffic >> More Sales >> More Selection
		+ Leads to lower cost & prices
	- Understand the customer pain points and the stoppage/barriers they face
		+ i.e: One click ordering
		+ Make things easier, people are lazy
	- Start with the customer and work backwards
	- Identify, Innovate, Implement
		+ Identify: Needs >> Generate Idea >> Evaluate Opportunity
		+ Innovate: Discover solution >> Select Solution >> Refine Solution 
		+ Implement: Finalize solution >> Product Distribution >> Transition to operational scale
	- 5 Working Backward release:
		1. Who is the customer?
		2. What is the customer problem or opportunity
			a. Why
			b. what is it better then (what's the alternative)
		3. Is the most important customer benefit clear?
		4. How do you know what customer need or want
		5. What does customer experience look like
	- If there are problems with the output, they can be attributed to the inputs
		+ Inputs: Customer Focused; What does "she" want
		+ Outputs: Business Focused; Sales & Profitability
	- If you cant change customer behavior, no point in doing it
	- When talking to leadership, be:
		+ Crisp
		+ Clear
		+ Focus
	- Regularly audit your inputs
		+ If you're not seeing output, probably has to do with the input
	- Lots of innovation available for what Customers care about:
		1. Selection
		2. Price
		3. Delivery speed / accuracy
	- Use data to disprove not to confirm

	- My Takeaways:
		+ Focus on the customer, that will lead to success
